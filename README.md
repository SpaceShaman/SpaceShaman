I'm a full stack developer living in the milky way, I focus much more on the backend because that's where the business rules are usually located. I love designing IT systems based on [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). My native language is [Python](https://www.python.org/) and my favorite technologies include [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev/), [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev), [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/), [Marvin](https://www.askmarvin.ai/), [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), [Factory Boy](https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), and I also love creating user interfaces using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/). I try to stay up to date with all technological innovations and use the latest technologies to facilitate work, I think that AI Driven Development is the future of our industry, writing code has never been as easy as it is today, which is why I think that as programmers we should focus today primarily on designing [clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). I am also a fan of [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) and [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) methodologies.
